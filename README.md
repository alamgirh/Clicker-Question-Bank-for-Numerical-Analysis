Open-Access Clicker Question Bank for Numerical Analysis
This open educational resource (OER) is a bank of over 250 multiple-choice and true-false questions that explores the material taught in a typical introductory undergraduate course in numerical analysis. The questions are typeset in LaTeX and are intended for classroom use with clickers (also known as student response systems) where students use a hand-held clicker remote or smartphone to submit their responses to questions. The project is described in the following paper which also serves as a "how-to guide":
